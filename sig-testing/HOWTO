Doing sig testing on two files:

 $ ./make_tabular.sh <gold> <pred1> [<metric>]
 $ ./make_tabular.sh <gold> <pred2> [<metric>]

where metric is either 'muc', 'bcub', 'ceafe', 'ceafm', 'conll', or
'all', where all is all four. if <metric> is omitted, 'all' is used.
(we never used blanc, since they were not part of the v7 scorer)

for each metric, make_tabular.sh creates a new file:
<predX>.doctab.{muc,bcub,ceafe,ceafm}


then do the sig testing by running

 $ ./sigstat.m <pred1>.doctab.<metric> <pred2>.doctab.<metric>

if you want to change the p-value, you have to edit the sigstat.m and
set the value differently.
